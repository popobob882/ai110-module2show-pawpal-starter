# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Sample Output

Output from running `python main.py`:

```
Today's Schedule:
- [HIGH] 08:00 - Morning feeding for Mochi (10 min)
- [HIGH] 10:00 - Vet checkup for Rex (45 min)
- [MEDIUM] 18:00 - Evening walk for Rex (30 min)

No conflicts found.
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

```bash
# Run the full test suite:
pytest

# Run with coverage:
pytest --cov
```

Sample test output:

```
tests/test_pawpal.py::test_mark_complete_changes_status PASSED           [ 50%]
tests/test_pawpal.py::test_add_task_increases_pet_task_count PASSED      [100%]

============================== 2 passed in 0.08s ==============================

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

> Fill in once you've implemented scheduling logic.

| Feature | Method(s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Task sorting | Scheduler.build_schedule | Sorts by priority (high > medium > low) first, then by preferred time |
| Filtering | *(not yet implemented)* | Planned: skip/defer tasks once the day is fully booked |
| Conflict handling | Scheduler.detect_conflicts | Flags any two tasks whose time + duration windows overlap |
| Recurring tasks | Task.recurring, Task.recurrence_rule | Tasks can be flagged as recurring. Regenerating recurring tasks each day is not implemented yet |
